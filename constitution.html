                        as "roster dumping" and can be a rare occurance or even be done unintentionally.

                        <br /> It just needs to be said that this is extremely frowned upon in our leauge to drop a large portion(or best players) of your roster and obstructing the waiver wire. </p>

                    <p align="left">
                        Each team can start a max of 40 players each week. Going over that limit before or after the week is finished will result in the HIGHEST scoring player(s) from the final day being SUBTRACTED from your total score of that week. It is up to the managers
                        to field exactly their best 40 to avoid the penalty.
                        <br />
                        <br /> If a player is placed in a roster spot in your lineup but does NOT play any minutes, then that player will NOT be added to your team’s weekly total.
                        <br />
                        <br /> * Also if for some reason ESPN decides to count a player put into your active roster towards your total AND that player did not enter the game at any point, please message a commissioner so we can edit the teams weekly total.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The Weekly Player Total can be viewed by clicking the "Full Box Score" button inside the matchup window on the "scoreboard tab".

                        <br />
                        <br /> There is no automatic block for playing over 40 players from ESPN. It will let you go over the player limit by default, howevre one of us will check the weekly totals on Sunday nights after the completetion of all games and adjust
                        the scores if a/any manager has gone over the limit. All scoring adjustments are then posted to the leauge page the following day for complete transparency.

                        Trading Draft Picks:
                        <br /> Managers are allowed to trade draft picks once they are officially signed up for that current season. ALL draft pick trading must be done prior to the first pick of the draft. (Our leauge currently does not allow trading of future
                        draft picks.)

                         Managers are allowed to trade players immediately after the draft has concluded. Our league trade deadline has always been March 1st (two weeks after the official NBA trade deadline.) Managers are encouraged to post on the leauge
                        Facebook Page with who is on their "trading block" and/or any postion they are looking for specifically in a trade.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Rules:

                        <br /> Once a trade has been accpected by both teams the changes will not take embed effect for 48 hours(if approved byt the league). A league commssioner will alsovpost the trade on the league page with voting options. Managers then
                        have 2 days to vote to "accept" or "veto" the trade before it is offically completed.
                        <br />
                        <br /> ALL trades must have less than 5 votes from other managers after 2 days of it being accepted for it to be confirmed and processed.
                        <br />
                        <br /> In most cases trades will be approved. However if the trade is unblanced and provides a substanstial advantage to a team, then it is up to the other owners in the league to veto the trade and maintain league integrity.
